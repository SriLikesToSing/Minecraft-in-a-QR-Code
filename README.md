## Usage

Install required python packages through 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Download my software and run
```bash
  python3 catridge.py -d "folder name of images that are stored in"
```
There will be an output file called "OUTPUT.txt" that results after you run the program

Bext type
```bash
  base64 -d OUTPUT.txt > BRUHMOMENT.kdb
```
Once you have done that u will have a binary file ready to be compiled
To run this file do

```bash
  chmod +x BRUHMOMENT.kdb
```
finally type in

```bash
  ./BRUHMOMENT.kdb 
```

You have officially ran minecraft from a piece of paper baby.
